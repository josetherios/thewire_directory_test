Building a simple HTML directory of HBOs The Wire
This will be my first project in HTML using what I have learned from the Odin Project. This will be a simple directory of HBO's The Wire. I will create a series of webpages containing information for different characters, organizations and institutions from the show. As I work on this project, what the directory consists of will probably change and grow. It will also potentially incorporate different aspects of web design as I learn more, if the project permits. 12-11-2023
